			<p>Why 4-2-1-3, we adopt attacting football style but always stay safe, we are set positive mentallity during the match,
			so we not only focusing on attacking movement but also defending movement. We are using high defensive line engagement for every match, why? because we want our player stay close / or not too far from each other so the player easily to pass. But the weakness is if the opponent using fast counter-attack, so this is why we also need strong center defender who has run ability to cover it. 
			</p>
			<p>On midfield, the combination DLP, BBM, and natural CM work perfectly on our team. DLP will sit in front of defender above def line engagement during attacking and sometimes help attacking. BBM is very important, he help can attack and defend perfectly so BBM is important.
